/**
 * Constant-time, boolean-masked Montgomery ladder bigint exponentiation
 *
 * Calculates: C = modexp(A, d) = A^d mod M
 *
 * This routine implements a constant-time modular exponentation Montgomery
 * ladder using Boolean-masked exponents in two shares (d0, d1) as proposed by
 * Tunstall et al.
 *
 *   [1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1226.pdf
 *
 * The individual bits of the exponent shares randomize the memory accesses of
 * intermediate values in each iteration thus inhibiting horizontal attacks that
 * exploit leakage spanning multiple rounds. As the exponent is re-masked for
 * every exponentation vertical attacks over multiple traces are mitigated as
 * well.
 *
 * The input A is blinded for each exponentiation using the inverse-free
 * technique by technique Ebeid and Lambert where
 *
 *   A^d = ((A*R^e)^(d-1))*(A*R^(e-1)) mod M
 *
 * For more information on this blinding strategy, the reader is referred to the
 * paper:
 *
 *   [2] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1873548.1873556
 *
 * The computation is carried out in the Montgomery domain, by using the montmul
 * primitive. The squared Montgomery modulus RR and the Montgomery constant m0'
 * have to be precomputed and provided at the appropriate locations in DMEM.
 *
 * This routine operates on the pre-defined memory locations set in
 * `run_rsa_modexp_mem`.
